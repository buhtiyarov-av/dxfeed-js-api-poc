# Basic Usage

## Import package

```ts
import DXClient from '@dxfeed/widgets-api'
```

## Configure & Create connection

Create instance of DXClient and set web socket address and open connection.

```ts
import DXClient from '@dxfeed/widgets-api'

const client = new DXClient('wss://CLIENT_NAME.dxfeed.com/api/rsocket')
```

## Configure & Create subscription
You should specify the record and the requested symbols.

```ts
import { QuoteSubscription } from '@dxfeed/widgets-api/records/Quote'

const subscription = await client.subscribe(
  new QuoteSubscription(
    ['AAPL'] /* symbols */
  )
)
```

The full list of records can be found here:
```js
import { /* Subscription */ } from '@dxfeed/widgets-api/records/*'
```

You can also request only specific fields, not the entire event.
```ts
client.subscribe(
  new QuoteSubscription(
    symbols,
    ['eventSymbol', 'bidPrice'] /* fields */
  )
)
```

For timed subscription you should also provide time to start subscription from.

```ts
client.subscribe(
  new CandleSubscription(
    symbols,
    fields,
    1500000000000 /* from time */
  )
)
```

## Change symbols in subscription

### Add symbols

```ts
subscription.addSymbols(['MSFT'])
```

### Remove symbols

```ts
subscription.removeSymbols(['AAPL'])
```

## Get events from stream
After an open subscription, you can listen to events from the stream.

```ts
const stream = subscription.getStream()

stream.subscribe({
  onSubscribe: sub => {
    sub.request(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) // set backpressure
  },
  onNext: handleEvents,
})
```

`onNext` its event handler for process incoming events.

```ts
import { Quote } from '@dxfeed/widgets-api/records/Quote'

const handleEvents = (events: Quote[]) => {
  /* process events */
}
```

## Close subscription stream
All `onSubscribe` callbacks that are called with a subscription, you need to call the `subs.close` method to close the stream.

```ts
stream.subscribe({
  onSubscribe: sub => {
    setTimeout(() => sub.close(), 5000) // close after 5s
  },
  onNext: console.log,
})
```

## Close connection
If you need to close the web socket connection

```ts
client.close()
```
